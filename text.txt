Data whisperer by day, chart magician by night. I'm a data analyst with 3 years of experience wrangling numbers into insights so good, they deserve their own spotlight. 

Excel? My keyboard sings its praises. SQL? My queries pirouette through databases. Python? We tango like old friends. And Power BI? Let's just say my dashboards are art museums for your KPIs. 

When I'm not wrangling data, you'll find me brewing chai (strong, like my analyses) and plotting my next data conquest.
